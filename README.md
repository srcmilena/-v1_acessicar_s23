### 3rd project submission, module 4
Project proposed by Recode and developed in a squad, where it was requested the creation of a technological solution for a minority group. The squad 23 was the niche for PwD's. From there, several situations and needs were approached, where it was filtered and decided to develop an application focused on urban transportation for people who have difficulties with physical mobility, focusing on wheelchair users.
